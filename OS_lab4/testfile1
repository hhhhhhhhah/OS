[Verse 1]
Taa la look at these hands
Taa la look at these hands
The hand speaks
The hand of a government man
Well I'm a tumbler
Born under punches
I'm so thin

[Chorus 1]
All I want is to breathe
(I'm too thin)
Won't you breathe with me?
Find a little space
So we move in-between (in-between it!)
And keep on step ahead, of yourself

[Verse 2]
Don't you miss it, don't you miss it
Some 'a you people just about missed it
Last time to make plans
Well I'm a tumbler
I'm a government man

[Chorus 2]
Never seen anything like that before
Falling bodies tumble 'cross the floor
(But I'm a tumbler)
When you get to where you wanna be
(Thank you! Thank you!)
When you get to where you wanna be
(Don't even mention it!)

[Verse 3]
Take a look at these hands
They're passing in-between us
Take a look at these hands
Take a look at these hands
You don't have to mention it
No thanks
I'm a government man
